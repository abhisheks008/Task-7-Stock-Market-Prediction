# Task-7-Stock-Market-Prediction
Here I have created the model of Stock Market Prediction using the TensorFlow Modelling 

Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines

● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)

● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com

● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6

● Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model

● You are free to select a different stock to analyze and news dataset as well while not changing the objective of the task.
